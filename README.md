Online Shoppers Intention – Machine Learning Project
📌 Overview

This project explores the Online Shoppers Intention Dataset, which contains session-level data about e-commerce website users. The goal is to analyze customer behavior and build a machine learning model to predict whether a visitor will generate revenue (make a purchase) or not.

The project includes:
Dataset (online_shoppers_intention.csv)
Python script (online_shoppers_intention.py) for data preprocessing, visualization, and modeling

📂 Files
online_shoppers_intention.csv
The dataset containing attributes like administrative pages visited, product pages, bounce rates, visitor type, month, weekend, and revenue.
online_shoppers_intention.py
Python script for:
Data loading and cleaning
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Encoding categorical features (Month, VisitorType, etc.)
Feature scaling
Model training (Logistic Regression, etc.)
Evaluation with metrics like confusion matrix and classification report

⚙️ Requirements
Install the following Python libraries before running the script:
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn

🚀 How to Run
Clone or download this repository.
Place both files (online_shoppers_intention.csv and online_shoppers_intention.py) in the same directory.
Open a terminal and run:
python online_shoppers_intention.py

📊 Output
Prints dataset head and missing values check.
Encodes categorical variables using OneHotEncoder.
Splits dataset into training and test sets.
Trains a Logistic Regression model.
Displays evaluation metrics:
Confusion Matrix
Classification Report
Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score
Shows visualizations (heatmaps, charts).

🔮 Future Improvements
Add more ML models (Random Forest, XGBoost, Neural Nets).
Perform hyperparameter tuning.
Deploy the model as a web app (e.g., with Flask or Streamlit).
